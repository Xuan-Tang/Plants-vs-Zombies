The project's name:  Plants vs. Zombies
The project's description: This project is an adapted version of a very famous game called plants vs. zombies. The main goal is to kill all the zombies using several plants. The project has three levels of difficulty. In the easy level, there are two types of plants, only 10 zombies and players can also get some hints on how to plant sunflowers. In the medium level, there are three types of plants, 20 zombies and zombies are moving faster. In the hard level, there are two types of plants, 30 AI zombies that can move across the rows, and players can get some hints on how to plant sunflowers. 
The way to run the project: Open tp3.py and run it in the editor. 
The libraries I'm using that need to be installed: I use Python Imageing Library(PIL), but I think it has already been installed as long as you can run cmu_112_graphics.py. 
The shortcut commands: 
1. If you press 's', you can increase the total amount of suns to be 2000 so that you can plant any plant you want.
2. If you press 'z', it will increase the rate of producing zombies so that you don't need to wait for the zombies to appear.
3. If you press 'f', it will decrease the cooldown time for the sunflowers in the following time.
4. If you press 'p', it will decrease the cooldown time for the peashooters in the following time.
5. If you press 'n', it will decrease the cooldown time for the snow-peashooters in the following time.
